## Search Term Cards ##

A small Flask app which displays popular site-search terms pulled from Google Analytics. Used to display [popular search terms on edX](http://edx-search-terms.herokuapp.com/) at edX's Cambridge office. Inspired by and modeled after Google's own [Hot Searches](http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends/visualize?pn=p1) visualization.
