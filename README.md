## Search Trends ##

A small Flask app which displays popular site-search terms pulled from Google Analytics. Used to display popular search terms at [edX](https://www.edx.org/)'s Cambridge office. Inspired by and modeled after Google's own [Hot Searches](http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends/visualize?pn=p1) visualization.
